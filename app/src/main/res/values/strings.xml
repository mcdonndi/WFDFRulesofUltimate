    <!--Article 1-->
    <string name= "article_1_point_1">Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed sport. All players are responsible for
administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that
places the responsibility for fair play on every player.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_2">It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh
penalties for breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which
simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3">Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration
between teams. Players must:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_1">know the rules;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_2">be fair-minded and objective;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_3">be truthful;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_4">explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_5">allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_6">resolve disputes as quickly as possible, using respectful language;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_7">make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_8">only make a call where a breach is significant enough to make a difference to the
outcome of the action.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_4">Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between
        players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play. </string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5">The following actions are examples of good spirit:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_1">informing a team-mate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary call or caused
a foul or violation;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_2">retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was necessary;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_3">complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_4">introducing yourself to your opponent; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_5">reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6">The following actions are clear violations of the spirit of the game and must be avoided
by all participants:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_1">dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_2">intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_3">taunting or intimidating opposing players;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_4">disrespectful celebration after scoring;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_5">making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s call; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_6">calling for a pass from an opposition player.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7">Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_1">take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and good spirit;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_2">discipline players who display poor spirit; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_3">provide constructive feedback to other teams about how to improve their
adherence to the Spirit of the Game.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_8">In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of ignorance of the rules,
experienced players are obliged to explain the infraction.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_9">An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides on-field arbitration, may
supervise games involving beginners or younger players.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_10">Rules should be interpreted by the players directly involved in the play, or by players
who had the best perspective on the play. Non-players, apart from the captain, should
refrain from getting involved. However players may seek the perspective of non-players
to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the appropriate call for “down” calls
and line calls.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_11">Players and captains are solely responsible for making all calls.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_12">If, after discussion, players cannot agree what occurred in a play, the disc shall be
returned to the last non-disputed thrower.</string>
    <!--Article 2-->
    <string name= "article_2_point_1">The playing field is a rectangle area with dimensions and zones as shown on Figure 1.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_2">The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two (2) sidelines along the
length and two (2) endlines along the width.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_3">The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_4">The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from the end zones and are
part of the central zone.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_5">The brick mark is the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1) metre lines in the central
zone set eighteen (18) metres from each goal line, midway between the sidelines.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_6">Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones) mark the corners of the
central zone and the end zones.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_7">The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear of movable objects. If
play is obstructed by non-players or objects within three (3) metres of the perimeter
line, any obstructed player or thrower in possession may call “Violation”.</string>
    <!--Article 3-->
    <string name= "article_3_point_1">Any flying disc acceptable to both captains may be used.</string>
    <string name= "article_3_point_2">WFDF may maintain a list of approved discs recommended for use.</string>
    <string name= "article_3_point_3">Each player must wear a uniform that distinguishes their team.</string>
    <string name= "article_3_point_4">No player may wear items of clothing or equipment that reasonably could harm the
wearer or other players.</string>
    <!--Article 4-->
    <string name= "article_4_point_1">A game consists of a number of points. Each point ends with the scoring of a goal.</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_2">A game is finished and won by the first team to score seventeen (17) goals.</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_3">A game is separated into two (2) periods of play, called halves. Half time occurs when a
team first scores nine (9) goals.</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_4">The first point of each half starts when the half starts.</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_5">After a goal is scored, and the game has not been won or half time has not been
reached:</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_5_point_1">the next point starts immediately; and</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_5_point_2">the teams switch the end zone that they are defending; and</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_5_point_3">the team that scored becomes defence and pulls next.</string>
    <string name= "article_4_point_6">A variation of the basic structure may be used to accommodate special competitions,
number of players, age of players or available space.</string>
    <!--Article 5-->
    <string name= "article_5_point_1">Each team will put a maximum of seven (7) players and a minimum of five (5) players on
the field during each point.</string>
    <string name= "article_5_point_2">A team may make (unlimited) substitutions only after a goal is scored and before the
next pull, except for injury (Section 19).</string>
    <string name= "article_5_point_3">Each team will nominate a captain to represent the team.</string>
    <!--Article 6-->
    <string name= "article_6_point_1">The captains of the two teams fairly determine which team first chooses either:</string>
    <string name= "article_6_point_1_point_1">whether to receive or throw the initial pull; or</string>
    <string name= "article_6_point_1_point_2">which end zone they will defend.</string>
    <string name= "article_6_point_2">The other team is given the remaining choice.</string>
    <string name= "article_6_point_3">At the start of the second half, these initial selections are switched.</string>
    <!--Article 7-->
    <string name= "article_7_point_1">At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, play commences with a throw-off,
called a pull.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_1_point_1">Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_2">The pull consists of a defensive player throwing the disc to begin play, after both teams
have signalled their readiness by having at least one player on each team raise a hand
above their head.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_3">Once ready, and until the pull is released, all offensive players must stand with one foot
on their defending goal line without changing position relative to one another.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_4">All defensive players must be entirely inside their defending end zone when the pull is
released.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_5">If a team breaches 7.3 or 7.4 the opposing team must call the violation (“offside”) before
the receiving team touches the disc. The pull must be repeated as quickly as possible.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_6">As soon as the disc is released, all players may move in any direction.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_7">No player on the defensive team may touch the disc after a pull until a member of the
offensive team contacts the disc or the disc contacts the ground.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_8">If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the disc before it hits the
ground, and the offensive team fails to catch it, that is a turnover (a “dropped pull”).</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_9">If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes out-of-bounds, or is
caught in-bounds, the thrower establishes the pivot where the disc stops.</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_10">. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds without
contacting an offensive player, the thrower establishes the pivot at the point on the
central zone closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.7)</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_11">If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds after
contacting an offensive player, or an offensive player catches the pull out-of-bounds, the
thrower establishes the pivot at the point on the playing field closest to where the disc
became out-of-bounds (Section 11.5).</string>
    <string name= "article_7_point_12">If the disc contacts the out-of-bounds area without first touching the playing field or an
offensive player, the thrower may establish the pivot either at the brick mark closest to
their defending end zone, or at the spot on the central zone closest to where the disc
went out-of-bounds (Section 11.7). The brick option must be signalled by the intended
thrower before picking up the disc by fully extending one arm above their head.</string>
    <!--Article 8-->
    <string name= "article_8_point_1">The disc is dead, and no turnover is possible:</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_1_point_1">After the start of a point, until the pull is released;</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_1_point_2">After the pull or after a turnover when the disc must be carried to the location
of the correct pivot point, until a pivot is established; or</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_1_point_3">After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked
in.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_2">A disc that is not dead is live.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_3">The thrower may not transfer possession of a dead disc to another player.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_4">Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the ground.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_5">If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly alters the disc’s position, the
opposition may request that the pivot be established at the location where the disc was
contacted.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_6">After a turnover, the team that has gained possession of the disc must continue play
without delay. The intended thrower must move at walking pace or faster to directly
retrieve the disc and establish a pivot.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_6_point_1">If the offence breaches 8.6 the defence may give a verbal warning (“Delay of
Game”) or may call a “Violation”.</string>
    <string name= "article_8_point_6_point_2">If the intended thrower is within three (3) metres of the pivot point and, after
the verbal warning, continues to breach 8.6 the marker may commence the stall
count.</string>
