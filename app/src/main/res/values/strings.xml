    <!--Article 1-->
    <string name= "article_1_point_1">Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed sport. All players are responsible for
administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that
places the responsibility for fair play on every player.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_2">It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh
penalties for breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which
simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3">Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration
between teams. Players must:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_1">know the rules;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_2">be fair-minded and objective;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_3">be truthful;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_4">explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_5">allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_6">resolve disputes as quickly as possible, using respectful language;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_7">make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_3_point_8">only make a call where a breach is significant enough to make a difference to the
outcome of the action.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_4">Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between
        players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play. </string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5">The following actions are examples of good spirit:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_1">informing a team-mate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary call or caused
a foul or violation;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_2">retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was necessary;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_3">complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_4">introducing yourself to your opponent; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_5_point_5">reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6">The following actions are clear violations of the spirit of the game and must be avoided
by all participants:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_1">dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_2">intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_3">taunting or intimidating opposing players;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_4">disrespectful celebration after scoring;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_5">making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s call; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_6_point_6">calling for a pass from an opposition player.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7">Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_1">take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and good spirit;</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_2">discipline players who display poor spirit; and</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_7_point_3">provide constructive feedback to other teams about how to improve their
adherence to the Spirit of the Game.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_8">In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of ignorance of the rules,
experienced players are obliged to explain the infraction.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_9">An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides on-field arbitration, may
supervise games involving beginners or younger players.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_10">Rules should be interpreted by the players directly involved in the play, or by players
who had the best perspective on the play. Non-players, apart from the captain, should
refrain from getting involved. However players may seek the perspective of non-players
to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the appropriate call for “down” calls
and line calls.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_11">Players and captains are solely responsible for making all calls.</string>
    <string name= "article_1_point_12">If, after discussion, players cannot agree what occurred in a play, the disc shall be
returned to the last non-disputed thrower.</string>
    <!--Article 2-->
    <string name= "article_2_point_1">The playing field is a rectangle area with dimensions and zones as shown on Figure 1.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_2">The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two (2) sidelines along the
length and two (2) endlines along the width.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_3">The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_4">The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from the end zones and are
part of the central zone.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_5">The brick mark is the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1) metre lines in the central
zone set eighteen (18) metres from each goal line, midway between the sidelines.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_6">Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones) mark the corners of the
central zone and the end zones.</string>
    <string name= "article_2_point_7">The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear of movable objects. If
play is obstructed by non-players or objects within three (3) metres of the perimeter
line, any obstructed player or thrower in possession may call “Violation”.</string>
